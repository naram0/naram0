- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeremy!
- 👀 I’m currently working through the curriculum at TOR.
- 🌱 At the moment, I'm learning the basics on HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to get better at programming and eventually one day make my own website to serve as my resume.
- 📫 You can reach me best on discord @jnaram#1513 or on twitter @naram0_ ! Hope to hear from you!!
